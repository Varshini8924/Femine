        PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) and PCOS : Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, Diet and Treatment
         PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) is a medical condition in women, where the ovaries produce multiple immature eggs which, over time, become cysts on the ovaries.
        
         
        
        What is Polycystic Ovary Disorder (PCOD)?
        Ovaries are the reproductive organs of a female which control the menstrual cycle and the production of hormones like estrogen, progesterone, inhibin, relaxin etc. The accumulation of the eggs swells the ovary and makes it release large quantities of male hormone thus causing infertility. 
        
        PCOD is a hormonal condition that affects approximately 5- 10% of women in their childbearing ages (12 to 45-years). While the prevalence of PCOD differs, it affects around 9% to 22% of Indian women. The numbers are about 2% to 7% in China and Sri Lanka.
        
        In this condition, the hormones of a woman go out of balance which creates various symptoms, including the absence of ovulation, irregular menstrual cycle, difficulty conceiving, weight gain, acne, and hirsutism. PCOD, also known as PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome), if left untreated, can lead to further health complications, like diabetes, obesity, heart diseases, and high cholesterol.
        
        Common Symptoms of PCOD/PCOS
        PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) often starts showing symptoms around the time of the first menstrual cycle during puberty, but it can also develop later, especially with weight gain over the years.
        
        Common signs of PCOD include:
        
        Increased androgen levels: High levels of male hormones can lead to excess facial and body hair, as well as male-pattern baldness.
        Irregular periods: You may experience irregular or delayed periods due to problems with egg maturation.
        Difficulty getting pregnant: Hormonal imbalances can prevent eggs from maturing and being released, which can affect ovulation and make it harder to conceive. Many women are diagnosed with PCOD when they seek help for difficulty getting pregnant.
        Hair loss or thinning: Excess male hormones can cause hair to thin or fall out.
        Acne: Hormonal imbalances may lead to acne on the skin.
        Weight gain: Many women with PCOD experience weight gain or have difficulty losing weight.</p>
      
      <h3>Postpartum Depression</h3>
      <p>Postpartum depression (PPD) is a prevalent and potentially severe mood disorder that affects approximately 1 in 7 women within the first year after childbirth. PPD stems from a combination of hormonal changes, genetic predisposition, and environmental factors, yet up to 50% of cases remain undiagnosed due to the stigma surrounding the condition and patients' reluctance to disclose symptoms. Unlike the transient "baby blues," PPD is more severe, often manifesting as persistent sadness, low self-esteem, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and difficulties bonding with the baby. Effective recognition and management of PPD are essential for optimizing the health outcomes of the parent and infant.

        This activity describes the evaluation of postpartum depression and how to differentiate it from other mood disorders that may occur in the postpartum period. Participants learn to identify the various etiologies and clinical presentations of PPD, as well as the underlying biochemical and psychological pathways. This activity also emphasizes the importance of routine screening using tools like the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and also highlights the roles of psychotherapy, support groups, and safe medications in treatment. Collaborating with an interprofessional healthcare team is highlighted, helping participants enhance their ability to implement best practices for treating and preventing PPD, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Regulatory guidelines are also covered to ensure a standardized approach to PPD care.
        
        Objectives:
        
        Identify the specific signs and symptoms of postpartum depression, including persistent sadness, low self-esteem, sleep disturbances, anxiety, loss of appetite, and difficulty bonding with the baby.
        Differentiate postpartum depression from other mood disorders that may occur in the postpartum period, such as the "baby blues," postpartum psychosis, and generalized anxiety disorder, by understanding their unique clinical presentations and durations.
        Apply the latest evidence-based guidelines and best practices for managing postpartum depression, staying updated with current research and clinical recommendations to optimize patient outcomes.
        Apply interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and outcomes for patients with postpartum depression.</p>
      
     

      <h3>Menstrual Disorders</h3>
      <p>Menstrual disorders are a disruptive physical and/or emotional symptoms just before and during menstruation, including heavy bleeding, missed periods and unmanageable mood swings.

        Some women get through their monthly periods easily with few or no concerns. Their periods come like clockwork, starting and stopping at nearly the same time every month, causing little more than a minor inconvenience.
        
        However, other women experience a host of physical and/or emotional symptoms just before and during menstruation. From heavy bleeding and missed periods to unmanageable mood swings, these symptoms may disrupt a woman's life in major ways.
        
        Most menstrual cycle problems have straightforward explanations, and a range of treatment options exist to relieve your symptoms. If your periods feel overwhelming, discuss your symptoms with your health care professional. Once your symptoms are accurately diagnosed, he or she can help you choose the best treatment to make your menstrual cycle tolerable.</p>

      <h2>Mental Health Challenges at Different Life Stages</h2>
      <h3>Adolescence</h3>
      <p>Adolescents face challenges like body image issues, social pressures, and hormonal changes.adolescence, transitional phase of growth and development between childhood and adulthood. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines an adolescent as any person between ages 10 and 19. This age range falls within WHO’s definition of young people, which refers to individuals between ages 10 and 24.

In many societies, however, adolescence is narrowly equated with puberty and the cycle of physical changes culminating in reproductive maturity. In other societies adolescence is understood in broader terms that encompass psychological, social, and moral terrain as well as the strictly physical aspects of maturation. In these societies the term adolescence typically refers to the period between ages 12 and 20 and is roughly equivalent to the word teens.

During adolescence, issues of emotional (if not physical) separation from parents arise. While this sense of separation is a necessary step in the establishment of personal values, the transition to self-sufficiency forces an array of adjustments upon many adolescents. Furthermore, teenagers seldom have clear roles of their own in society but instead occupy an ambiguous period between childhood and adulthood. These issues most often define adolescence in Western cultures, and the response to them partly determines the nature of an individual’s adult years. Also during adolescence, the individual experiences an upsurge of sexual feelings following the latent sexuality of childhood. It is during adolescence that the individual learns to control and direct sexual urges.</p>

      <h3>Motherhood</h3>
      <p>Balancing family, work, and personal needs can lead to mental health struggles in mothers.Motherhood. One of the most powerful words and experiences. It reflects differently on each mother and is one of the most sacred journeys you will travel in life.
But what does it actually mean? What is motherhood? And what does it mean to be a mother? First you feel that there is a simple answer to this question, but is it really?
A human growing in your belly, giving birth or even adopting. You say yes to having a family. But being a mother is about much more than that.
And especially it is very different from personality to personality. Finding words for a feeling is hard and motherhood is all about feelings and our heart, isn’t? The love we feel. Towards our own children but not to forget our own mums too. The joys and difficulties, complex relationships, the sacred bond and dreams.</p>

      <h3>Middle Age and Senior Years</h3>
      <p>Women may experience mental health issues related to menopause, loneliness, or grief.Middle Aged and Older Adults Physical Activity Life Cycle
Exercise: is a physical activity that is intended to keep a person healthy and fit. Exercising is bodily movements and actions designed to impact and improve one’s aerobic conditioning, physical strength/endurance through weight training (bone/muscle strengthening) and stretching/flexibility.
Also a well-balanced physical activity program that is both structured and a continual habit can improve one’s overall mental health and endurance. Exercising for middle aged and older adults especially can significantly improve balance to reduce the fear of falling. </p>
